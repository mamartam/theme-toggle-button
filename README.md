# Theme toggle button

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 – Semantic markup for the toggle structure.
- CSS3 – Advanced styling, including:
   - Flexbox for alignment.
   - Linear & Radial Gradients for dynamic backgrounds.
   - Transitions & Transforms for smooth, high-performance animations.
   - Layered Z-indexing for the parallax cloud effect.
- JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic for theme switching and handling state.
- Web Storage API (LocalStorage) – To save and persist the user's theme preference across sessions.

## 💻 The Process
I started by setting up a clear project structure, organizing all the necessary files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and placing the visual assets into a dedicated folder. Once the environment was ready, I built the core HTML framework to establish a solid foundation for the toggle component.

The next phase involved extensive styling with CSS, where I focused on creating smooth transitions and positioning the decorative elements to achieve the desired visual effect. After the design was polished, I implemented the functional logic using Vanilla JavaScript to make the switcher interactive. As a final touch, I integrated LocalStorage to ensure the user's theme preference is preserved in the browser’s memory, providing a consistent experience upon return.

## 📚 What I Learned
Building this project was a great learning experience that helped me sharpen both my technical and design skills. I gained a deep understanding of how to style complex UI components from scratch, moving beyond simple buttons to create a multi-layered, interactive switcher.

One of the key takeaways was mastering LocalStorage. I learned not only how to save the user's choice but also how to handle the initial state: providing default styles when a user visits the site for the first time and the storage is still empty. Additionally, I improved my skills in creating fluid CSS animations, learning how to synchronize multiple elements like clouds and celestial bodies. Most importantly, this project taught me how to bridge the gap between static design and functional logic to create a visually appealing and technically sound web experience.

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?
While the project is fully functional, there are several ways to enhance it further:

- Performance Optimization: Some CSS properties could be refactored using CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for colors and transition timings. This would make the code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.
- Advanced Animations: Adding a subtle "floating" animation to the clouds using @keyframes would give the toggle a more "alive" and dynamic feel even when it's not being clicked.
